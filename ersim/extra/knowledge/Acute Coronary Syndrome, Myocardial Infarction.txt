Education: Acute Coronary Syndrome / Myocardial Infarction

Common chief complaint:
Nonpleuritic chest pain

Differential:
 * Aortic dissection
 * Pulmonary embolism
 * Myocarditis
 * Costochondritis
 * Acute cholecystitis
 * Pancreatitis
 * Esophageal spasm
 * Pneumonia

Patient History:
 * Chest pain
   * O - usually between 20 minutes to 1 hour
   * P - substernal
   * Q - crushing, pressure-like
   * R - left arm, neck, jaw, back, shoulder, abdomen
   * S - variable
   * T - constant 
   * A - not alleviated by NTG, worse with physical exertion
   * D - not breathing
   * A - dyspnea, diaphoresis, nausea, vomiting
 * Recent angina
 * Recent aspirin use
 * Age greater than 65 years
 * Tobacco use
 * Cocaine use
 * FmHx - CAD, HTN, hypercholesteremia, diabetes
 * PmHx - coronary artery stenosis of greater than 50%

Physical Exam:
 * Blood pressure - examines blood volume and hemodynamic stability
 * Cardiac exam
   * New apical systolic murmur (mitral regurgitation 2/2 papillary muscle rupture)
   * S3 or S4
 * Pulmonary exam
   * Rales

Investigations:
Labs:
 * CMP - examines end organ ischemia with renal and liver function
 * Troponins - examines heart damage
 * CKMB - examines heart damage
 * Urine toxins - determines history of cocaine use

Imaging:
 * EKG - determine the location of myocardial infarction, special attention to inferior wall MI
 * Echocardiogram - examines left ventricular function
 * Chest Xray - rule down other pathology (pneumonia, fractures, pneumomediastinum, etc.)

Management:
 * Calculate TIMI score
 * Assess hemodynamics

Primary Intervention:
 * If hemodynamically unstable consider
   * Dobutamine IV and Nitroglycerin if left ventricular failure but MAP is greater than 90
   * Nitroprussive IV if left ventricular failure and MAP is less than 90
   * Intra-aortic balloon pump if patient is in shock (see shock criteria)
 * Immediate MONA (4mg IV morphine q10min as needed, 4L/min Oxygen nasal cannula, Nitroglycerin, 325mg PO Aspirin chewed)
 * Fluid resuscitation if hypovolemic to improve diastolic filling
 * Furosemide if hypervolemic to improve blood pressure and systolic function as well as coronary filling

 * Rapid PCI - door to balloon time of less than 90 minutes.
 * CABG - if severe triple vessel disease
 * Fibrinolysis - if PCI is unavailable
  
 * Initiate metoprolol after acute event resolves but within 24 hours

Secondary Intervention:
 * Stop smoking
 * HTN control with furosemide
 * Cholesterol control with pravastatin
 * Exercise for minimum of 30 min/day
 * Weight loss
 * Continued Beta Blockers with metoprolol
 * ACE inhibitor for cardio/renal protection with captopril
