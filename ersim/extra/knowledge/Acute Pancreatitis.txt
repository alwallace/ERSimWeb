   * Chvostek + Trousseau signs if hypoCa2+
   * Cullens sign if hemorrhagic pancreatitis
   * Grey Turners sign if hemorrhagic pancreatitis

Investigations:
Labs:
 * CMP - evaluate hydration status, special attention to Ca2+
 * CBC - looking for increase in WBCs
 * LDH
 * Strict Ins and Outs
 * Urine trypsinogen 2 - rapid screening for pancreatitis with abdominal pain, high sensitivity
 * ABG - assess PaO2 and pH for lactic acidosis

Imaging:
 * Abdominal Xray
 * Chest Xray - rule down other pathology in the chest
 * Abdominal ultrasound - examine pancreas and biliary system, gallbladder
 * CT or MRI abdomen - accurately determine pancreatic inflammation, stones, etc.

Management:
 * Use Ranson criteria for pancreatitis evaluation

Primary Intervention:
 * IV Fluids, normal saline
 * Strict NPO
 * NG tube placement and suction
 * Morphine IV for pain
 * Electrolyte replacement of Ca, Mg, K
 * If patient is septic, demonstrated abscess or calculi then initiate antibiotics, ampicillin and cefotetan 5-7 days
