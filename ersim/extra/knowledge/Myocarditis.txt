Education: Myocarditis

Common chief complaint:
Nonpleuritic chest pain

Differential:
 * MI
 * Esophageal spasm
 * Cholelithiasis
 * Pancreatitis
 * Aortic dissection
 * Chostochondritis
 * Pneumonia
 * Pulmonary embolism

Patient History:
 * Pain
   * O - 
   * P - 
   * Q - 
   * R - 
   * S - 
   * T - 
   * A - 
   * D - 
   * A - dypsnea
 * Feels feverish
 * Recent (1-3 weeks ago) flu-like syndrome (fever, joint pain, malaise)
 * Short of breath
 * Ethanol use
 * CO inhalation
 * Cocaine use
 * PmHx - Connective tissue disorders (SLE, scleroderma, sarcoidosis), vasculitis (kawasaki's disease), cancer, radiation treatment
 * FmHx - Connective tissue disorders (SLE, scleroderma, sarcoidosis), vasculitis (kawasaki's disease) 

Physical Exam:
 * Blood Pressure - hypotension
 * Cardiac
   * Mild S1 sound
   * Tachycardia
   * Arrythmia
   * S3 or S4
   * New mitral regurgitation murmur
   * Jugular venous distention
 * Abdomen
   * Hepatomegaly
 * Extremities
   * Peripheral edema

Investigations:
Labs:
 * Troponins, CKMB - assess any heart damage
 * LDH
 * CMP - assess renal function
 * ESR - initial to establish baseline, subsequently to follow progress of treatment
 * CBC - looking for increased WBCs to help establish diagnosis
 * Viral blood titers
 * Cold agglutinin / ASO / Blood cultures
 * Lyme titer - if in endemic area

Imaging:
 * EKG - determine if any myocardial damage, assess arrythmia
 * Chest Xray - rule down other pathology
 * Echocardiogram - assess ventricular function, dilatation
 * Cardiac MRI - more accurate assessment of echocardiogram

Management:

Primary Intervention:
 * Treat the underlying infection or toxic component based on cultures / titers / labs
 * If patient is having heart failure
   * Initiate diuretics, furosemide
   * Initiate ACE inhibitor, lisinopril
   * Na restriction diet
 * If patient has an arrythmia
   * Initiate procainamide to manage arrhythmia
   * Initiate anticoagulation to prevent clot formation or extension, warfarin with heparin bridge
