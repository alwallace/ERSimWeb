For patients presenting to the emergency department with chest pain suspicious for an acute coronary syndrome, the diagnosis of STEMI can be confirmed by the electrocardiogram. Biomarkers may be normal early. (See <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction?source=see_link" class="medical medical_review">"Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction"</a> and <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-acute-coronary-syndrome-in-the-emergency-department?source=see_link" class="medical medical_review">"Initial evaluation and management of suspected acute coronary syndrome in the emergency department"</a>.)</p><p>Once the diagnosis of an acute STEMI is made, the early management of the patient involves the simultaneous achievement of several goals:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Relief of ischemic pain</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Assessment of the hemodynamic state and correction of abnormalities that are present</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Initiation of reperfusion therapy with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or fibrinolysis</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Antithrombotic therapy to prevent rethrombosis or acute stent thrombosis</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Beta blocker therapy to prevent recurrent ischemia and life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias</p><p></p><p>This is then followed by the in-hospital initiation of different drugs that may improve the long-term prognosis:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Antiplatelet therapy to reduce the risk of recurrent coronary artery thrombosis or, with PCI, coronary artery stent thrombosis.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor therapy to prevent remodeling of the left ventricle</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Statin therapy</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Anticoagulation in the presence of left ventricular thrombus or chronic atrial fibrillation to prevent embolization</p><p></p><p>This topic will summarize <span class="nowrap">emergent/early</span> management issues for patients with acute STEMI and then direct the reader to a more detailed discussion in other topics. The management of the patient after a reperfusion strategy has been chosen and carried out is discussed separately. (See <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-non-acute-management-of-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction?source=see_link" class="medical medical_review">"Overview of the non-acute management of ST elevation myocardial infarction"</a>.)</p><p>The management of the patient with a non-ST elevation MI or with a complication of an acute MI (eg, cardiogenic shock, mitral regurgitation, ventricular septal defect) is discussed separately. (See <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-acute-management-of-unstable-angina-and-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction?source=see_link" class="medical medical_review">"Overview of the acute management of unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction"</a> and <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction?source=see_link" class="medical medical_review">"Prognosis and treatment of cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction"</a> and <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction?source=see_link" class="medical medical_review">"Mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H162183500"><span class="h1">STEMI AFTER HOSPITAL ADMISSION</span>&nbsp;—&nbsp;A minority of patients who sustain an acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) do so while hospitalized for another reason. The approach to such patients is generally similar to that for patients that present to emergency departments, which is presented in the sections that follow.</p><p>However, patients with STEMI after hospital admission appear to have more co-morbidities and thus are more likely to have a complex or atypical presentation. In addition, they have worse outcomes than those who present to the emergency department. <br><br>The following two observational studies highlight these differences:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>In a retrospective study that compared 48 inpatient to 227 outpatients with STEMI (2007 to 2011), the following findings were noted [<a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-acute-management-of-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1" class="abstract_t">1</a>]:</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Inpatients were older and more likely female. They had higher rates of chronic kidney disease and prior cerebrovascular events.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Inpatient STEMI was heralded by change in clinical status 60 percent of the time and by complaints in 33 percent. The time to first electrocardiogram (ECG) from healthcare provider recognition of the onset of the ischemic event was longer in inpatients (41 versus 5 minutes). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Coronary angiography and percutaneous coronary intervention were performed in 71 and 56 percent of cases </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Compared to outpatients, the average time from ECG to first device activation was significantly longer (129 versus 60 minutes) for inpatients.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Survival to discharge was significantly lower for inpatient STEMI (60 versus 96 percent), despite similar sized infarcts.</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Using a comprehensive, prospective database of 3795 patients with STEMI (2003 to 2013), 83 patients with in-hospital STEMI were compared to 640 patients who arrived in the emergency department by ambulance (emergency medical services) and 267 patients who were driven by family or themselves [<a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-acute-management-of-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/2" class="abstract_t">2</a>]. The following was noted: </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Common reasons for the initial hospital admission in patients with STEMI after hospital admission included non-ST elevation acute coronary syndrome, surgery, respiratory failure, and percutaneous coronary intervention (complicated by stent thrombosis).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>The in-hospital patients were older and had higher body mass indices, higher rates of hypertension, and more complex presentations (including cardiac arrest and cardiogenic shock). </p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>In-hospital patients had a significantly prolonged length of stay and longer diagnostic-to-balloon times than those using emergency medical services but not those compared to <span class="nowrap">self/family</span> driven patients (76 versus 51 and 66 minutes, respectively).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Time to treatment within 90 minutes occurred less often with STEMI after hospital admission (68 versus 91 percent).</p><p></p><p class="bulletIndent2"><span class="glyph">•</span>Patients with STEMI after hospital admission had similar in-hospital mortality, but a higher one-year mortality (16.9 versus 9.4 percent) compared to all patients who presented to the emergency department.</p><p></p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H2"><span class="h1">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span>&nbsp;—&nbsp;The 2013 American College of Cardiology <span class="nowrap">Foundation/American</span> Heart Association guideline for the management of acute ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) recommends that each community develop and maintain a regional system of STEMI care that encourages assessment and continuous quality improvement of emergency medical services and hospital-based STEMI care activities [<a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-acute-management-of-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/3,4" class="abstract_t">3,4</a>].</p><p>An increasing number of centers use structured algorithms, checklists, or critical pathways to screen patients with a suspected acute coronary syndrome (ACS) [<a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-acute-management-of-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/5-10" class="abstract_t">5-10</a>]. These strategies combine diagnostic evaluation such as electrocardiography and serum biomarkers with therapeutic interventions such as <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-drug-information?source=see_link" class="drug drug_general">aspirin</a>, beta blockers, antithrombotic therapy, and primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or fibrinolytic therapy (<a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/image?imageKey=CARD%2F75032&topicKey=CARD%2F66&rank=1%7E150&source=see_link" class="graphic graphic_table graphicRef75032 ">table 1</a>). (See <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-evaluation-and-management-of-suspected-acute-coronary-syndrome-in-the-emergency-department?source=see_link" class="medical medical_review">"Initial evaluation and management of suspected acute coronary syndrome in the emergency department"</a>.)</p><p class="headingAnchor" id="H3"><span class="h2">Elderly patients</span>&nbsp;—&nbsp;Although the majority of MIs in the elderly population present with electrocardiograms (ECGs) that are nondiagnostic or have ST segment depression, STEMI is not uncommon [<a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-acute-management-of-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/11" class="abstract_t">11</a>]. It is estimated that 60 to 65 percent of STEMIs occur in patients ≥65 years of age and 28 to 33 percent occur in patients ≥75 years of age [<a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-acute-management-of-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/11-13" class="abstract_t">11-13</a>]. In addition, as many as 80 percent of all deaths related to MI occur in persons ≥65 years of age. (See <a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-acute-management-of-unstable-angina-and-non-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction?source=see_link&anchor=H4#H4" class="medical medical_review">"Overview of the acute management of unstable angina and non-ST elevation myocardial infarction", section on 'Elderly patients'</a>.)</p><p>Although patients age 75 and older have been underrepresented in clinical trials of ACS, the following observations concerning acute MI in elderly compared to younger patients are generally accepted [<a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-acute-management-of-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/11" class="abstract_t">11</a>]:</p><p class="bulletIndent1"><span class="glyph">●</span>Elderly patients more frequently have an atypical presentation, including silent or unrecognized MI [<a href="http://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-acute-management-of-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/11,14" class="abstract_t">11,14</a>]. As an example, chest pain is present in 57 percent of patients ≥85 years of age compared to 90 percent for those under age 65.
