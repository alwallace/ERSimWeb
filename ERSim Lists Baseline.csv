hpi,Unknown,I started having chest pain today when I was watching TV this morning after getting my cup of coffee. I was standing in the kitchen just pouring the coffee into my cup when it happened. After the pain started I tried to take nitroglycerin tablets as I was told and I waited between them but they didn't help to stop the pain. That is when my I called for the ambulance which brought me here.,I started having chest pain this afternoon while playing golf. It hurts a lot and is different than anything I've had before so I had my partner drive me to the hospital.
